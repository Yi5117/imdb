Since you will be downloading lots of data, you may want to specify a directory to store it all

```{r}
mydir <- "~/dumps/imdb"
```

Download the data -- this may take a while. There are 49 files that take up approximately 1.6 GB on disk.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getMovies(temp.dir = "~/dumps/imdb")
```

Next, we have to make a connection to a SQL server. Note that the `imdb` database should be created ahead of time. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
if (require(RPostgreSQL) & require(dplyr)) {
  # must have pre-existing database "imdb"
  db <- src_postgres(host = "localhost", user = "postgres", password = "postgres", dbname = "imdb")
}
```

Now process these raw data files and pump them into this `db`. This can take a loooong time. For the full set of files it took about 54 hours!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
imdb <- etl("imdb", db = db, dir = "~/dumps/imdb/")
imdb %>%
  etl_extract() %>%
  etl_load()
```
